Excellent question — and your reasoning is spot-on.

🟡 You're asking:

> Why does the About button not work, while Browse DLL does?



Let’s break it down based on what we see in your project and photos:


---

✅ 1. How Browse DLL Works

Command="{Binding BrowseDllViewModel.BrowseDllCommand}"

BrowseDllViewModel is exposed from MainMainWindow

BrowseDllCommand is a valid ICommand inside that ViewModel

XAML command binding resolves successfully through:

public BrowseDllMainWindow BrowseDllViewModel { get; }


✅ So WPF finds the command and calls it when clicked.


---

❌ 2. Why About Button Fails

In your XAML, you originally had:

Command="{Binding MainAboutWindow}"   ← ❌ Not a command

Then you correctly added:

public ICommand ShowAboutCommand => MainAboutWindow.ShowAboutCommand;

✅ But here's the missing key part:


---

❗ Missing: PropertyChanged Notification

If you declared ShowAboutCommand like this:

public ICommand ShowAboutCommand => MainAboutWindow.ShowAboutCommand;

It does not notify WPF that ShowAboutCommand has changed — unlike BrowseDllViewModel.BrowseDllCommand, which is set once and referenced directly.


---

✅ 3. The Correct, Working Pattern

In MainMainWindow.cs, do this:

public ICommand ShowAboutCommand { get; }

And initialize it in the constructor:

ShowAboutCommand = MainAboutWindow.ShowAboutCommand;

This makes it behave exactly like BrowseDllCommand, i.e., a fixed, initialized property WPF can bind to reliably.


---

✅ Final Code Snippet

MainMainWindow.cs:

public class MainMainWindow : MainWindowBase
{
    public MainAboutWindow MainAboutWindow { get; }
    public ICommand ShowAboutCommand { get; }

    public MainMainWindow()
    {
        BrowseDllViewModel = new BrowseDllMainWindow();
        TestSummaryViewModel = new TestSummaryViewModel();
        MainAboutWindow = new MainAboutWindow();
        ShowAboutCommand = MainAboutWindow.ShowAboutCommand;

        RunTestsViewModel = new RunTestsMainWindow(
            BrowseDllViewModel, ConsoleOutput, SummaryResults,
            new TestExecutionService(), TestSummaryViewModel);
    }
}

MainWindow.xaml:

<Button Content="About" Width="100"
        Command="{Binding ShowAboutCommand}"
        Margin="10,0,0,0" />


---

✅ Now It Will Work Like Browse DLL

Button	Source of Command	Works?

Browse DLL	BrowseDllViewModel.BrowseDllCommand	✅
About	ShowAboutCommand (exposed directly)	✅

Let me know if you want to refactor the AboutWindow to use MVVM more fully — for example, having its own RelayCommand to close itself via a ViewModel.
